# Java-Autocompleter

This program, when ran, gives suggestions for what a user is typing. Enter each character one at a time, and enter "!" at any point to exit. Enter a number 1-5 corresponding to the predictions of the program in order to choose a selection. The user history will be saved to a file called user_history.txt and will be loaded back into the program at the start of each execution. This autocompleter uses a DLB to predict what words could follow next, and more information about implementation specifics can be found in approach.txt.
